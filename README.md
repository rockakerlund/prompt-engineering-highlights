# Prompt Engineering Insights & LLM Auditing

Welcome! I’m a system-oriented prompt engineer and concept designer with strong semantic intuition, working across LLMs like Gemini Flash, Claude 3 Opus, and GPT-4o.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Increasing structured output accuracy (e.g. PDF-to-CSV scraping improvements from 93% → 98%+)
- Modular prompt logic and silent error detection
- Meta-level analysis of prompt behavior and model misalignment
- Multi-agent orchestration and iterative feedback design

## 🛠 Tools & Models I Use

- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro / Flash
- Claude 3 Opus (for structural and logical consistency)
- GPT-4o (for neutral framing and hallucination resistance)
- Python (data flows, script auditing)
- Prompt-flow testing frameworks

## 👁️ My Approach

I don't just "write prompts" — I identify the **systemic patterns** behind model behavior, optimize them, and often reveal overlooked bottlenecks.

## 📩 Want to collaborate?

Let me audit your prompt, model output, or flow — even a 1-hour session can lead to significant performance boost.  
Open to short reviews, process redesign, or end-to-end collaboration.
